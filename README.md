Solutions to the [2025 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025) by Anthony Berry

Each part for each day is stored in a separate file.
Solutions are uploaded in a very similar state to how they originally were, when first obtaining the correct answer.
These may be updated in following commits.

# Running

# Lessons
1. Got to make the most of the 12 days!
2. Regex solutions can always make you feel stupid.
3. Thinking for a little bit always helps!
4. Reading the puzzle input for those few extra seconds always comes in handy.
